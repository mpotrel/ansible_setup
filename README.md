# WIP

This repository contains all the must have installations for my workflow.
This is still a WIP because I am working on different things at the moment, and I do not want to rush this one.

I am planning to make it cross platform, to integrate all important software to me as well as making it clone and copy some of my dotfiles and personal scripts (most of which are currently private).
